# GDPR Compliance Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines how Dana AI complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how our platform helps our customers meet their own GDPR obligations. GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states.

## Dana AI as a Data Controller and Processor

Dana AI acts in two capacities under GDPR:

1. **Data Controller**: For data we collect about our users (customers who use our platform).
2. **Data Processor**: For end-user data that our customers process through our platform.

## How Dana AI Complies with GDPR

### 1. Lawful Basis for Processing

Dana AI processes personal data under the following lawful bases:

- **Contractual Necessity**: Processing needed to fulfill our service contracts with customers
- **Legitimate Interest**: When processing serves our legitimate business interests while respecting individuals' rights
- **Consent**: When specific, informed, and unambiguous consent is obtained for certain processing activities
- **Legal Obligation**: When processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations

### 2. Data Subject Rights

Dana AI supports the following rights for EU data subjects:

| **Right to Erasure** | Users can request deletion of their data, which will be processed within 30 days |
| **Right to Restrict Processing** | Users can request restriction of processing, and we will flag the account accordingly |
| **Right to Data Portability** | Data can be provided in a structured, machine-readable format upon request |
| **Right to Object** | Users can object to certain types of processing, particularly those based on legitimate interest |
| **Rights Related to Automated Decision Making** | Dana AI implements appropriate safeguards when automated decision-making is used |

### 4. Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)

We conduct DPIAs for high-risk processing operations, including:
