# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide explains the performance optimizations that have been implemented in the Dana AI Platform and how to apply them.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Frontend Optimizations

- **Code Splitting with Lazy Loading**: All page components are now loaded on-demand using React.lazy() and Suspense
- **Enhanced Caching Strategy**: Dynamic cache times based on data type (short cache for messages, longer for platforms)
- **Skeleton Loading UI**: Improved user experience with placeholder content during lazy loading

### 2. Database Optimizations

- **Database Indexes**: Added indexes on frequently queried columns for all tables
- **Compound Indexes**: Added multi-column indexes for common filtering patterns
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized queries to leverage the new index structure

## Applying Database Optimizations

To apply the database performance optimizations, run the following command:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/optimize-database.ts
```

This script will:
1. Add all the necessary indexes to the database tables
2. Update the PostgreSQL query planner statistics
3. Verify all optimizations were applied successfully

## Using Optimized Queries

The optimized query functions are available in `server/query-optimizations.ts`. Use these functions instead of writing raw queries to ensure best performance:

Example usage:

```typescript
import { conversationQueries } from "./query-optimizations";

// Get recent conversations with optimized query
const recentConversations = await conversationQueries.getRecent(userId, 10);
```

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor the application's performance using the browser developer tools to ensure that:

1. Time-to-first-byte (TTFB) is improved due to database optimizations
2. Initial load time is reduced due to code splitting
3. API response times are faster with the optimized database queries

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any performance issues:

1. Check the database indexes are properly applied
2. Ensure the React Query cache is configured correctly
3. Verify lazy-loaded components are working as expected
